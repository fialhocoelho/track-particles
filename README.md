# Track Particle
This project is the first version of track particles and is part of SPRACE center. 

# Run
To run main-paralel.py file over a gpu machine or you can use test_1_lstm_paralel.ipynb notebook to run into Google Colab.

# Accuracy of Algorithm

```
[Output] ---Regression Scores--- 
	R_2 statistics        (R2)  = 0.97
	Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) = 0.17
	Mean Absolute Error   (MAE) = 0.085

RMSE:		[0.170] 
RMSE features: 	[0.15, 0.23, 0.09] 
R^2  features:	[0.97, 0.94, 0.99] 
```
